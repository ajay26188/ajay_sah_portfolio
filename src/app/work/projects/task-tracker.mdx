## Overview

TaskTracker is a modern, full-stack project management app designed for teams to **collaborate, assign tasks, and track progress**. The project emphasizes clean architecture, scalability, and real-world development practices such as role-based access and modular API design.  

Currently, backend development is in progress (~65 hours logged). The project is being built iteratively to simulate company-like workflows, with a public development log available in the [TaskTracker GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ajay26188/task_tracker).

## Key Features (so far)

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login with JWT, including role-based middleware for access control.  
- **Organizations**: Company-level data isolation ensures projects and tasks stay scoped to each organization.  
- **Projects & Tasks**: API endpoints for project creation, task creation, and task assignment.  
- **Filtering & Queries**: Query-based task filtering (e.g., `GET /api/tasks?projectId=...`).  
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Strong input validation with Zod and consistent API response formats.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB + Mongoose  
- **Validation**: Zod  
- **Authentication**: JWT (with access control)  
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript (coming soon)  
- **Dev Tools**: ESLint, TypeScript, Nodemon  

---

## Roadmap (Next Steps)

- Connect frontend (React + TypeScript) to backend API  
- Build **Kanban-style task board** for project visualization  
- Implement task completion tracking & history  
- Add team dashboards with charts & insights  
- Support file uploads for tasks  

---

## Challenges & Learnings

- Designing APIs that balance **flexibility** with **consistency**.  
- Implementing organization-based data isolation early to ensure scalability.  
- Using Zod schemas to enforce **strict validation** and reduce runtime errors.  
- Building a workflow that mimics **real-world ticketing & development processes**.

## Outcome (so far)

Even though the project is still in progress, TaskTracker already demonstrates:  
- A strong backend foundation with auth, projects, and tasks working.  
- Scalable patterns for future growth (frontend + dashboards).  
- A realistic, company-like workflow with modular code and version control practices.  

When complete, TaskTracker will serve as both a **portfolio showcase** and a **learning milestone** in full-stack development.
