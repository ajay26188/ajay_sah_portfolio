## Overview

**TaskTracker** is a modern, full-stack project management app designed for teams to **collaborate, assign tasks, and track progress**.  
The app emphasizes **clean architecture, scalability, and real-world practices** such as role-based access, modular API design, and automated deployments.  

Currently, backend and frontend are integrated and live (~120 hours logged).  
Development follows a company-like workflow with a public log available in the [TaskTracker GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ajay26188/task_tracker).

## Project Status

- **Backend**: Authentication, organizations, projects, and tasks functional with role-based access control.  
- **Frontend**: Live UI connected to backend APIs with secure login and Redux-powered notifications.  
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipelines ensure only passing builds are deployed.  
  - **Backend** on Render  
  - **Frontend** on Vercel

## Roadmap (Next Steps)

- Build **Kanban-style task board** for project visualization  
- Add task completion tracking & history  
- Implement dashboards with charts & insights  
- Support file uploads for tasks  

---

## Challenges & Learnings

- Balancing **API flexibility** with consistent contracts.  
- Ensuring **organization-based isolation** early for scalability.  
- Using Zod schemas to enforce **strict validation** and reduce runtime errors.  
- Designing CI/CD pipelines to simulate **real-world team workflows**.  

---

## Outcome (so far)

TaskTracker already demonstrates:  
- A strong backend foundation with auth, orgs, projects, and tasks.  
- Live frontend integrated with backend APIs.  
- Scalable patterns for future features like dashboards and Kanban boards.  
- A company-like workflow with modular code, CI/CD, and detailed logs.  

When complete, TaskTracker will serve as both a **portfolio showcase** and a **learning milestone** in full-stack development.
